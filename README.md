# Usage

### 1. Sending HTTP Requests
Piramit HTTP provides an easy-to-use interface for sending HTTP requests. You can use it to make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and other types of requests.

### Example: Sending a GET Request
```php
<?php
use Piramit\Http\Client;

$client = new Client();
$response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/data');

echo $response->getBody();
?>
```

### Explanation:

- This example demonstrates how to send a simple `GET` request to an `API` endpoint.
- We instantiate a new Client object, then use the `get()` method to request data from `https://api.example.com/data`.
- The response body is accessed using `$response->getBody()` and printed to the console.


### Example: Sending a POST Request

```php
<?php
use Piramit\Http\Client;

$client = new Client();
$response = $client->post('https://api.example.com/submit', [
    'json' => [
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john.doe@example.com',
    ]
]);

echo $response->getStatusCode();  // 200
echo $response->getBody();        // Response body
?>
```

### Explanation:

- This example demonstrates how to send a `POST` request with `JSON` data.
The `post()` method is used to send data to the `https://api.example.com/submit` endpoint.
- The JSON data (name and email) is included in the request body.
The status code and response body are then printed out using `$response->getStatusCode()` and `$response->getBody()`.

### 2. Handling Responses
You can easily work with the response object returned from the HTTP client. The Response object provides methods for retrieving status codes, headers, and the response body.

### Example: Checking the Status Code
```php
<?php
$response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/data');
if ($response->getStatusCode() == 200) {
    echo 'Request was successful!';
} else {
    echo 'Request failed with status: ' . $response->getStatusCode();
}
?>
```

### Explanation:

- This example shows how to handle the response based on its status code.
- We send a `GET` request, then check if the status code is `200` (successful).
- If successful, we print "Request was successful!" Otherwise, we print the actual status code to help with debugging.

- ### Example: Getting Response Headers
```php
<?php
$response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/data');
$headers = $response->getHeaders();
print_r($headers);
?>
```

### Explanation:

- In this example, we retrieve the headers from the response object using the `getHeaders()` method.
- This can be useful for inspecting additional information about the response, such as C`ontent-Type` or `Authorization` headers.


### 3. Error Handling
Piramit HTTP also provides error handling mechanisms, allowing you to easily manage failed requests or unexpected situations.

### Example: Catching Exceptions
```php
<?php
use Piramit\Http\Exception\RequestException;

try {
    $response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/data');
} catch (RequestException $e) {
    echo 'Request failed: ' . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

### Explanation:

- This example demonstrates how to handle errors during HTTP requests.
- If the request fails or there is an issue, a RequestException is thrown.
- The catch block catches the exception and prints the error message, which can help identify the issue (e.g., network issues or invalid responses).


### Features
- **Simple API:** An easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests.
- **Support for All HTTP Methods:** `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more.
- **Request and Response Handling:** Easily work with HTTP requests and responses, including headers and bodies.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handle errors and failed requests.
- **Custom Headers:** Add custom headers to your requests for authentication or other purposes.
- **JSON Support:** Easily send and receive JSON data.

### Example: Full Example of Using Piramit HTTP
```php
<?php
use Piramit\Http\Client;

$client = new Client();

// Send GET request
$response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/data');

// Check if request was successful
if ($response->getStatusCode() == 200) {
    $data = json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
    echo 'Data received: ';
    print_r($data);
} else {
    echo 'Request failed with status: ' . $response->getStatusCode();
}

// Send POST request with JSON data
$response = $client->post('https://api.example.com/submit', [
    'json' => [
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john.doe@example.com',
    ]
]);

if ($response->getStatusCode() == 200) {
    echo 'Data successfully submitted.';
} else {
    echo 'Submission failed with status: ' . $response->getStatusCode();
}
?>
```

### Explanation:

- In this full example, we first send a `GET` request and check if the response status is `200`. If successful, we decode the JSON data and print it.
- Then, we send a `POST` request with a JSON payload (`name` and `email`).
The status of both requests is checked and appropriate messages are printed.


### Configuration
There are no complex configurations needed for this package, but you can extend its functionality by adding custom middleware or configuring custom headers for your requests.

### Example: Adding Custom Headers
```php
<?php
$client = new Client();
$response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/data', [
    'headers' => [
        'Authorization' => 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
    ]
]);

echo $response->getBody();
?>
```

### Explanation:

- This example demonstrates how to add custom headers to your requests, such as an `Authorization` header.
- The `Authorization` header is often used for token-based authentication, where `YOUR_API_TOKEN` would be replaced with a real token.
